This project is a boilerplate for a server-side rendering single-page application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The project started in early-January 2018. So, relatively new and contributions are appreciated.

#TODO
-Finish implementing hot-reload (i.e. need to modify sockjs-node to use the correct port)
-Create script for server development environment
-Refactor scripts to remove nodemon dependency in package.json
-Fix ports so npm run dev command doesn't prompt user to start client on another port
-Write tests


Please be aware the project is under active development and is NOT currently fully functional
